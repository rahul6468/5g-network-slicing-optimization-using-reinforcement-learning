5G Network Slicing Optimization using Reinforcement Learning
Overview:
  This repository contains code and resources for optimizing 5G network slicing using reinforcement learning techniques. Network slicing allows for the creation of virtual network segments tailored to specific applications or user groups, each with its own quality of service (QoS) requirements.

Features:
  Dynamic Resource Allocation: Utilize reinforcement learning to dynamically allocate resources within network slices based on real-time demand and network conditions.
Quality of Service (QoS) Optimization: Employ reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize QoS parameters such as latency, throughput, and reliability for different network slices.
Traffic Management: Utilize reinforcement learning to dynamically manage network traffic within and across different slices, ensuring efficient load balancing and congestion avoidance.
